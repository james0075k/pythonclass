TITLE: Syrian government reaches deal with Kurdish-led forces
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0pj0n0yk3o

Syria's government has reached a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance that would see the gradual intergration of Kurdish forces and institutions into the state.
This comes after weeks of clashes which saw Syrian troops reclaim large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under SDF control for more than a decade.
US envoy Tom Barrack called it "a profound and historic milestone in Syria's journey toward national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability".
Earlier this month - and after its major territorial losses - the SDF agreed to a ceasefire that saw much of its hold brought under government control, but reports of clashes continued.
Much like that 14-point agreement, Friday's deal would see SDF withdraw from points of contact, its members join the Syrian army and government, and the integration of its administrative and civil bodies into those of the state.
The SDF said the agreement also includes the formation of a military division consisting of three brigades made of its members.
The statement on X added that an agreement on the civil and educational rights for Kurdish people was also reached, as well as a guarantee that those displaced would be allowed to return to their homes.
Part of the deal saw the transfer of prisons, oil and gas fields - which were under SDF control - to Damascus.
Syrian troops seized control of the Omar facility, the country's largest oilfield, after the SDF pulled back. Earlier, the army took the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river.
The Kurds previously controlled nearly a third of Syria's territory with the support of the US after it helped defeat the Islamic State (IS) group.
Their recent losses mark the biggest change of control in the country since the toppling of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, which ended Syria's 13-year civil war.
Since leading the rebel offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify a divided Syria.
After the ceasefire was agreed on 18 January, he said he hoped it would allow the country to "end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress".
Sharaa also issued a decree recognising Kurdish cultural, linguistic and civil rights by making Kurdish a national language, granting nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring their new year a national holiday.
This is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946.
This agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail.
A UN spokesman said conditions inside the camp remained "tense and volatile" after Kurdish-led forces withdrew.
The move comes as Syrian government forces take control of north-eastern areas where Kurdish-led forces have long controlled.
The government announces a four-day ceasefire with the SDF, which says it was "compelled" to withdraw its fighters from al-Hol camp.
An agreement between the government and the SDF will bring an autonomous region in the north-east under state control.
The Kurdish-led SDF militia withdrew from the Omar oil field amid an eastward push by government forces.

TITLE: China has lifted sanctions on six British MPs and peers, Starmer says
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyel3z9xxno

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said China has lifted "all restrictions" on six current members of the British Parliament, after talks with President Xi Jinping.
Speaking to the BBC in Shanghai, Sir Keir said a travel ban and other sanctions "no longer apply" to those parliamentarians, which includes four Conservative MPs and two peers in the House of Lords.
The PM argued the outcome "vindicated" his approach and said he hoped President Xi would come to the UK when it hosts a G20 summit in 2027.
But in a statement, the sitting MPs and peers targeted said they "take no comfort" from the decision, which leaves others under sanction and that they "will not be silenced".
When asked about comments made by Donald Trump, who said seeking closer relations with China was "very dangerous", Sir Keir said he thought the US president was mostly directing his criticism at Canada rather than the UK.
Hitting back at critics such as the Conservatives, who have accused Sir Keir of "kowtowing" to China, the prime minister said "it would be foolhardy to sit with your head in the sand and refuse to engage".
"By engaging, we've taken advantage of opportunities and raised difficult and sensitive issues," Sir Keir said.
He said an agreement to halve import taxes on British whisky would come into force on Monday next week, but added the start date for a deal on visa-free travel for British citizens to China had not yet been agreed.
Downing Street regards the lifting of the sanctions as an example of what they call the "clear wins" they have secured on this trip.
China imposed the sanctions in 2021 and Conservative MPs Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Nusrat Ghani, Tom Tugendhat, Neil O'Brien, Tim Loughton - who is no longer in Parliament - were among those targeted.
Labour peer Baroness Kennedy and crossbencher Lord Alton, who are all members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, were also sanctioned.
They were banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, their property in China was frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions were prohibited from doing business with them.
The group are vocal critics of China and have accused the country of human rights abuses.The UK has confirmed it has not lifted sanctions on any Chinese individuals, but it is not known if restrictions have been lifted on other people sanctioned by China, including Loughton who stood down at the general election in 2024.
The lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, the chair of the Uyghur Tribunal, which is investigating atrocities against the minority group, was also sanctioned, as was the  Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on the Uyghurs.
In a new statement, the six current parliamentarians said they learned about the sanctions changes though media reporting and called for "clear assurances that UK sanctions against the four Chinese government officials responsible for genocide remain firmly in place".
They added: "The selective lifting of sanctions solely on sitting parliamentarians is wrong.
"Parliament exists to represent and defend the people of the United Kingdom -- Seeking or accepting preferential treatment for current MPs and peers sends a damaging signal that some are more deserving of protection than others."
They added that they would "take no comfort" in China's decision whilepro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai, a British citizen, remains imprisoned and Uyghurs continue to suffer atrocity crimes.
China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang.
The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
Coommenting on the decision to lift sanctions, the Chinese foreign ministry said: "The two sides agreed in principle to resume normal exchanges between the legislatures of the two countries.
"China welcomes British parliamentarians who have the willingness to visit China more and experience the real China."
Sir Keir's three-day trip to China - the first by a British prime minister since 2018 - is an attempt to thaw relations with the country, which is the second-biggest economy in the world behind the US.
The prime minister said the UK's relationship with China was in a "good, strong place" following his talks with Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Thursday.
Sir Keir said he knew the sanctions on MPs and peers were "a cause of concern, which is why I did raise it".
He said the lifting of those restrictions "rather vindicates my approach because it's only because we're here that we have had the engagement and that has provided the opportunity for a leader-to-leader discussion on sensitive issues".
But there is disquiet among critics of China who argue the country has a poor record on human rights and poses a threat to the UK's national security.
The Conservatives have argued Sir Keir should not have visited the country and that the trip was not in the national interest.
"Keir Starmer went to China from a position of weakness and got absolutely nothing in return," Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said.
"He has gone to China with a begging bowl because his entire economic policy is dependent on China."
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called on the prime minister to reject trade deals with China until Jimmy Lai is released from prison.
"This is a British citizen. It's the job of the British government to stand up and defend him, so before we sign anything let's free people like him," he added.
In the interview, Sir Keir was also asked about President Trump's comments about his trip to China.
The prime minister suggested the remarks "look to me as though they were directed more at the Canadians than us" and said the UK had discussed the China trip with the Trump administration.
Earlier this week, the US president threatened to impose tariffs on Canada if it went through with economic deals struck with China on a recent visit to Beijing by its Prime Minister, Mark Carney.
Trump has agreed to visit Beijing in April and has invited President Xi for a state visit to the US later this year.
On his trip, Sir Keir struck a number of deals with China, including an agreement aimed at tackling organised crime and illegal immigration will see the UK and China share intelligence to identify the supply routes of people smugglers.
Other deals include agreement to co-operate on reducing red tape for UK exporters and collaborate on health challenges such as antimicrobial resistance.
Sir Keir arrived in Shanghai on Friday morning, his last stop in China before leaving for Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart, Sanae Takaichi, for a working dinner.
The move follows Donald Trump's previous claim the US was taking the crucial Panama canal "back" from China.
It comes as Sir Keir Starmer visits Beijing - the first UK prime minister to do so in eight years.

TITLE: Ukraine sees quieter night as Trump says Putin will not attack its cities
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4yj92kwro

Ukraine has seen a relatively quiet night after Donald Trump said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had agreed not to attack Kyiv and "various towns"during a cold snap.
The Kremlin confirmed it had received the US president's request, but declined to give specifics about what was agreed.
While Trump did not say when the pause could begin, air raid alerts sounded in just eight Ukrainian regions overnight into Friday, with two minor injuries recorded in Zaporizhzhia.
Temperatures in the capital, Kyiv, are due to plummet to -24C (-11F) over the coming days. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as it has during cold periods since its invasion began.
Kyiv has previously seen periods without aerial attacks, so it is unclear whether a quieter night in the capital was a result of any agreement between Trump and Putin.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Putin had received a personal request from Trump to halt strikes on Kyiv until 1 February, to create favourable conditions for peace talks, but declined to comment further.
Ukrainian officials had been expecting a major attack this weekend ahead of the current cold spell - if that does not take place, it could mark a significant step in US-led efforts to bring the war to a close.
Ukraine's air force said more than 100 drones and a ballistic missile were fired at regions near the front line overnight.
But, as of Friday morning, there have been no fresh attacks on electricity or heating infrastructure crucial for keeping people warm.
Trump told a televised cabinet meeting in Washington DC on Thursday: "I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that."
He added: "It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it."
The US president said of the Ukrainians: "Almost they didn't believe it, but they were very happy about it because they are struggling badly."
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later wrote on social media that Trump had made an "important statement about "the possibility of providing security for Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this extreme winter period".
He told reporters on Friday that there had been no "direct dialogue or agreement" with Russia to pause attacks on energy infrastructure, but that Kyiv would act in kind if Moscow did so.
Ukraine has targeted oil depots and refineries within Russia in a bid to limit its ability to finance its invasion.
Meanwhile, residents of Kyiv who spoke to the BBC expressed scepticism about Trump's purported deal.
"I don't believe that Putin will stop even for a week," said Olena. "We have seen so many talks and deals but, nevertheless, he continues to do what he wants."
She added: "We have survived -20C recently, and if air strikes decrease even a little, then we'll overcome the next week as well."
Meanwhile, Hennadiy said he too did not believe Russia would stop targeting Kyiv's energy infrastructure, but expressed hope that it would.
"If we get a one-week respite, it will be good," he said. "These days, -30C is a catastrophe for us. Before it was OK and we could cope."
Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the United Arab Emirates last week for the first trilateral talks since the war began in 2022.
All sides described the talks as constructive, but while Zelensky said Russia pausing its attacks for the duration of the cold snap had been discussed, no agreement was announced.
Instead, attacks continued, crippling the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or electricity.
Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko has said 378 apartment blocks in the capital remain without heating.
Electrical companies have been carrying out round-the-clock repairs, but their work can be quickly undone by Russian air attacks.
Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes.
A second round of peace talks, scheduled to take place in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, may now be postponed and relocated due to "what's happening between America and Iran", Zelensky said.
Trump has threatened Tehran with military action over a crackdown on nationwide protests that human rights monitors say have led to thousands of deaths,as well as its nuclear programme.
Negotiations on a peace plan have been mediated by the US for months, with a key sticking point being Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.
Moscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine, including most of the eastern Donbas region. It wants Kyiv to hand over the areas of the Donbas it has not yet taken by force, while Ukraine reportedly wants Russia to hand back control of its largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.
"We are not ready for compromises that violate territorial integrity," Zelensky said on Friday. "We will not hand Donbas or the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Russians without a fight."
Additional reporting by Ben Hatton
The 55-year-old economist had been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term.
Tehran has threatened to treat an attack by the US as part of last summer's war, and its response could be more dramatic.
The US president says he has told Iran it has to do "two things" to avoid military action, as the US builds up its forces in the Gulf.
The US president's comments come as Sir Keir Starmer arrives in Shanghai on the third day of his visit to China.
Tom Homan says the immigration operation would be more "targeted", as the Trump administration works to calm frustrations both in the city and on Capitol Hill.

TITLE: Worried families in India urge return of crew on ship seized by Iran
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrenj55gdvo

The families of 16 Indian seafarers held in Iran since December say they are anxious about the fate of their loved ones as the geopolitical situation in the region remains tense.
On 8 December, Iranian authorities seized an oil tanker, MT Valiant Roar, while it was in international waters.They alleged that the ship, operated by Dubai-based Prime Tankers LLC, was carrying 6,000 metric tonnes of illegal diesel. The company has denied this.
Apart from the 16 Indians, the crew has one person each from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
The Indian families of the crew members have approached the Delhi high court, asking it to issue urgent directions to the government to secure consular access and ensure their safe return.
According to documents submitted by India's foreign ministry in a Delhi court, 10 of the Indian crew members have been arrested and moved to a jail in Iran while the others remain on board the ship. The ministry said it has now gained consular access to the 10 arrested men who are being held in Bandar Abbas prison.
"The Indian embassy has learned that the Iranian side will facilitate access to the six Indian seafarers on board the vessel once requisite clearances are received from the Iranian Navy/Prosecutor's office," it added.
Relatives of the detained crew members allege they have been confined to a tiny room on the vessel without proper food or potable drinking water. While most of their laptops and phones have been taken away, one phone was returned, allowing them to have limited contact with their families, they said.
The BBC has sent detailed questions to the Iranian embassy in Delhi about the allegations but has not received a response. Press Secretary Agha Mahdi Esfandiari said in a brief phone conversation that he had no information about Indian crew members being arrested or detained in Iran.
The BBC has also sent questions to the high commissions of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Delhi about the status of their citizens on the ship.
While Iran had granted approval for consular access to the 10 arrested Indians on 10 January, this "did not happen at that time, presumably, due to the prevailing situation in Iran", according to the documents.
The political situation in Iran has been turbulent over the past few weeks. Widespread protests broke out in the last week of December, initially triggered by anger against economic grievances and later expanding into calls for a regime change.
Since then, there has been a significant build-up of US military forces in the region, raising speculation ofa possible strike.
Jugwinder Brar, owner of Prime Tankers, told the BBC that the protests in Iran had prevented the company's lawyer from meeting the crew. He also denied the allegations by Iranian authorities, saying that the vessel was carrying Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO), a marine fuel used for refuelling the company's other ships in international waters.
"This is standard practice," he told the BBC.
He alleged that Iran also seized another ship owned by Prime Tankers in December 2023 due to similar claims of carrying illegal fuel. Of its 21 crew members, 18 were released after nine months, but three remain imprisoned, he said.
Brar insisted that both ships carried valid documents for VLSFO and the company's priority was to ensure the safe return of all crew members to India.
Brar and his companies, including Prime Tankers, are subject to US sanctions, with the treasury departmentallegingthat many of his vessels operate as "part of Iran's shadow fleet" to transport oil.
When asked why the US sanctioned him, Brar said: "America is an unchallenged country; no-one can question it. It can do whatever it wants."
He also claimed that Iran may have seized his ship as they "probably thought that the ship had an American or Israeli owner".
Domestic fuel prices in Iran are among the lowest in the world, mainly due to heavy government subsidies and authorities have said they routinely monitor maritime traffic around its waters to crack down on smuggling of fuel.
Families and company officials of the seized ship allege that the crew are being held in a small room, where they also sleep at night.
A relative of a detained crew member told the BBC on Thursday that food and fuel - which the Iranian navy last supplied nearly a week ago - are running low. The crew also does not have access to potable drinking water.
Another concern, the person added, is that most of the ship's generators have stopped working. This has led to problems with the vessel's waste disposal and cleaning mechanisms, leading to blocked toilets and unsanitary living conditions, they added.
The ship was seized weeks before many of the crew were due to complete their nine-month contracts in January.
Masood Alam, one of the 10 arrested men, is set to get married after Eid, which falls in March.
"We had a short call with him on 5 January. Since then, we have had no information. He was already suffering from fever when detained," his father, Ibrar Ansari, told the BBC.
Gayatri Singh, wife of chief officer Anil Kumar Singh, accused Iran of using the crew as "human shields".
Cargo disputes, she said, should be settled with companies, not workers.
"The company decides the cargo, not the crew. Sending them to jail is inhuman," said Pradeep Singh, general secretary of the Sailors' Union of India.

TITLE: Burkina Faso junta announces ban on all political parties
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevnlv9my1no

Burkina Faso's junta has announced a ban on all political parties, whose activities have been suspended since the military seized power in 2022.
Junta leader Captain Ibrahim Traoré has been criticised for suppressing dissent and the move will be seen as the latest move to tighten control.
According to Burkina Faso's Interior Minister Emile Zerbo, the ban is part of plans to "rebuild the state" after what he said were "numerous abuses" in the country's multiparty system.
Zerbo said the system had been "promoting division among citizens and weakening the social fabric".
Parties were previously banned from holding public gatherings but the new decree stops them from operating altogether.
All the assets of the dissolved parties would be transferred to the state, Zerbo said, adding that a draft law would be sent to the Transitional Legislative Assembly "as soon as possible".
The country had more than 100 registered political parties before the coup, with 15 represented in parliament after the 2020 general election.
"This will not help the country move forward. We're not happy with this," a member of a civil society group, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, told the BBC.
"The regime has been pushing the idea that democracy is useless or harmful for Burkina. [Traoré] may be settling in for the long run but given the country's history, no leader is ever fully secure. Another coup is never far from the horizon."
The banning of political parties also received some backlash on social media, but a number of other Burkinabes went online to support the junta's decision.
"It is undeniable that a country like Burkina Faso having over 100 political parties creates chaos," one Traoré supporter said on X.
"This fragmentation often led to clientelism and corruption, where parties function more like business ventures than civic organisations."
Traoré's 2022 coup ousted Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who had taken power only nine months earlier.
Traoré pledged to restore the civilian government by 1 July 2024 but two months before this deadline,the junta announced it would extend its rule for another five years.
Despite his authoritarian reputation, 37-year-oldTraoré has gained a huge following across the continentfor his pan-Africanist vision and criticism of Western influence.
Burkina Faso is among a string of West African countries who have experienced coups, followed by the restriction of political parties and electoral institutions, in recent years.

TITLE: Why the US dollar hit a four-year low and could fall further
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjg2rlyvyzo

After a dramatic 2025, when US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements sent the dollar tumbling, traders of the currency were expecting a quieter year.
Recent weeks have shattered that complacency.
The dollar dropped to its lowest point in four years on Tuesday against a basket of currencies, hitting multi-year lows against the Euro and the pound as it fell 3% in roughly a week.
That slide has since slowed down, but analysts say the reprieve is likely to be temporary.
"Most people would think the dollar should, could, and would weaken further this year," said Chris Turner, global head of financial market research at ING. "The jury's out on the timing but less so on the direction."
A weaker dollar reduces purchasing power for Americans - something overseas travellers know all too well. If that carries on, analysts say it risks fuelling inflation inside the US, as Americans face higher prices for imports.
The falls have also raised bigger questions about whether the dollar's status as the world's go-to currency - which for decades has helped keep borrowing costs in the US relatively low - might be under threat.
So what is driving down the dollar and what does it mean?
The dollar has been coming off more than a decade of strength, with especially sharp gains between 2020 and 2022, when America's post-pandemic growth and relatively high interest rates drove investor demand for the currency.
But last year, the dollar index, which tracks the value against a basket of currencies, dropped almost 10% - its worst performance since 2017. Much of that decline occurred in the weeks afterTrump's 'Liberation Day' tariff announcements last spring.
This month, the dollar slid further as tension grew between the US and Europe over Greenland.
And the losses continued this week, amid speculation that the US might be considering actions that would weaken the dollar further, including selling dollars along with Japan to help boost the yen, which was facing its own sell-off.
Analysts say say the dollar's downturn is in part a sign of market concern about the Trump administration's policies.
"In my opinion, what markets are reacting to is just sort of the haphazard nature of policy in this administration - the escalation, de-escalation," said Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former FX strategist at Goldman Sachs, pointing to similarities between the backlash over tariffs and Greenland.
The dollar's decline "is a reflection, basically, of markets saying this kind of chaotic back and forth hurts the US more than anyone else," he said.
While markets had appeared unfazed by bubbling geopolitical issues headed into the year, the rapid escalation in trade tensions over Greenland changed that, said Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and interest rate strategist at Macquarie.
"I think that's unnerved people," he said, noting that not only has the dollar dropped this month, bets that the currency will be hit by future swings have risen too.
There are other factors, such as increased investment opportunities overseas, and, in the recent days, the sell-off in the Japanese bond market.
That sell-off has led to some traders unwinding bets aimed at taking advantage of differences in value between the yen and the dollar.
Comments by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent denying that the US had intervened to help Japan helped stabilise the dollar this week.
But analysts said there was still uncertainty about what the Trump administration might do next.
The shift from the dollar has helped to fuel a surge in the price of gold, sending its price doubling over the last year, as investors seek a low-risk place to put their money.
And though other national currencies appeared to get little boost from redirected funds last year, there are signs that could be starting to change.
The Euro and pound were among the currencies to see their values leap against the dollar this month, while eleven of the 19 emerging market currencies tracked by Oxford Economics also gained more than 1%.
Global investors might also be turning against the US, with pension funds inAmsterdamandDenmarkcutting back holdings of US Treasuries.
However, Turner of ING said he thought markets were still well way from a "full 'sell America' narrative", noting that the sell-off action has been largely limited to the dollar.
He and others noted that the US stock market is still hovering around record highs, while moves in the market for US government debt have been relatively contained.
Still, ING is expecting the dollar to fall another 4% to 5% this year, as growth prospects outside of the US improve.
For now, the dollar's falls remain small enough that the impact for American consumers is likely to amount to "noise", Brooks said.
But what happens next will depend in part on US economic performance and how quickly the US central bank will lower interest rates.
Trump has mounted an intense campaign for lower interest rates more quicklyand is expected to install someone more sympathetic to those demands to lead the bank in the next few months.
If rates do fall, that might lower the dollar further as investors chase higher returns elsewhere.
But the White House could see that as a good thing, as Trump and other White House officials have previously welcomed the idea of a weaker dollar, which can help make US exports more competitive.
"It doesn't sound good, but you make a hell of a lot more money with a weaker dollar... than you do with a strong dollar," Trump said in July. This week, asked about the falls, he said he thought the currency was "doing great".
Brooks said a sustained drop in the dollar's value could help boost US firms - but warned that the pay-off might be limited if it happens for the "wrong reasons".
If it's the market rendering a verdict on poor policies, he warned "that is probably a very important signal".
Two Fed officials voted for a cut, including the former head of Donald Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.
Donald Trump is due to name a new leader of the Federal Reserve at a tricky moment.
One conservative justice warned that the White House interpretation of the law could "shatter" Federal Reserve independence.
Trade tensions and a reversal in the AI boom are among the main risks to global economic growth, the IMF says.
Donald Trump's stand-off with the US central bank has recalled episodes in other countries - which ended badly for the economy.

URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy82yp8xnno

Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan hasn't seen any visitors in more than five weeks, according to his party.
His family say this is partly to stop his words reaching the outside world. They blame the country's military chief, Field Marshall Asim Munir, a charge the government rejects. It says the meetings stopped because Khan broke jail rules prohibiting discussion of politics.
While Khan may be silenced, he's far from the only one under pressure.
Journalists, analysts and human rights advocates say the space to disagree with the state is increasingly limited – and the risks greater.
Last weekend, human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband were convicted of sharing anti-state social media posts.
The couple will spend 10 years in jail.
Ahead of sentencing, Amnesty International hadcalled on Pakistan to end "coercive tacticsused to silence dissent and intimidate those who defend human rights".
Khan's family are very clear about the effort to wipe him from the public's mind.
"There are two names you can't have on television. You can't say anything nice about Imran Khan, and you can't say anything bad about Asim Munir," his sister Aleema Khanum told the BBC. She was speaking at a recent protest by supporters a few kilometres from his cell in Rawalpindi's Adiala jail.
It's been more than eight weeks since Khan saw a family member, more than five since he met a lawyer and then it was only for eight minutes, his party says.
"This is the only way we have right now to create enough pressure that we are allowed to meet him," Khanum said at the protest. "It's his right to meet his lawyers, it's his right to meet his family, it's his communication with the outside world."
That communication from Khan has often been highly critical of Pakistan's government and military chief. After meetings inside the jail, Khan's words have often been posted on his X account, attributed to him and giving directions to his party and supporters.
"They are unable to block his voice because people want to hear him, they read his messages, they are not giving up on him," Khanum says.
But for now, with meetings stopped, so have those messages.
Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is convicted in several corruption cases which he says are politically motivated.
The government and military reject claims he is being held in isolation. Talal Chaudhry, an interior minister, has called him "the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan", with gym equipment and a cook.
After a post appeared quoting Khan on his X account, calling Munir a "mentally unstable person", the military spokesperson held a two-hour news conference broadcast across Pakistan's media, saying Khan had gone beyond politics and labelled him a national security threat.
"One could argue that the military is really leading the country on so many levels now that Pakistan's coming quite close to authoritarian rule," says Michael Kugelman, senior fellow on South Asia at the Atlantic Council.
"This is the worst the repression has been during any period of civilian rule."
Pakistan's military, often referred to as "the establishment", have been an ever-present factor in the country politics, including periods of military dictatorship.
Initially, Khan and the military appeared close; many believe their backing helped bring Khan to power and the opposition at the time initially accused him of being in thrall to the military while he governed. Khan's party denied this.
By the time he was ousted in a vote of no confidence in 2022, Khan had not only fallen out with the military leadership, but blamed them for his removal from power.
In November 2025, a constitutional amendment granted Munir lifetime immunity from prosecution and oversight of all Pakistan's defence forces.
Many saw it as a further sign that the military's influence over Pakistan was at a high-water mark under a civilian government.
The current government deny the military are calling the shots.
"The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove," Chaudhry says, adding the chief of defence forces "is doing a marvellous job".
Security sources said: "The military has always maintained it operates within legal bounds."
But Michael Kugelman and others see a connection between the military's involvement in politics and the amount of space to speak out.
"It's intrinsically linked to how strong or weak a democratic government is and what their relationship is with the military," says Munizae Jahangir, a journalist and co-chair for the Human Rights Council of Pakistan (HRCP).
"If the military is more dominant, there will be less space for protest, there will be less space for dissent, there will be less space for free expression."
Of those already jailed, Mazari is among the most prominent. A lawyer who has worked on some of the most sensitive cases in Pakistan, she and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were convicted of "disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups".
The government have defended their sentencing; in response Pakistan's information minister posted on X: "As you sow, so you shall reap!"
"Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced," Chaudhry said.
Other human rights advocates told the BBC they have faced limits on how they can operate.
HRCP say that their staff have been harassed on phone calls and stopped from holding round-table discussions at hotels unless they obtain permission in advance. The government says this is "to ensure security".
Journalists, too, say they have felt pressure. In 2023, the BBC reported that TVchannels had been told that they must not show Khan's face, his voice or say his name. The topics that should not be covered, according to journalists the BBC spoke to, have expanded.
"They [Pakistan's authorities] have controlled the mainstream media to a large extent," said Azaz Syed, a reporter for Geo TV. He says that even stories tangentially linked to the military – including one he recently did on a defence housing authority – have led to phone calls from unknown numbers with warnings to go no further.
Jahangir says she has even been told by editors not to cover certain stories.
"The editors are not doing this for fun. They do fundamentally believe in freedom of expression. They are doing this in order to survive," she says.
Journalists from other outlets who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said that a culture of self-censorship was now common in newsrooms.
"There were times in the past when there was complete censorship," one said. "Now there is self-censorship, which in many ways is worse because we are deceiving the audience."
The BBC approached the military for comment.
Security sources told us that ISPR, the military's communications arm, "does not regulate media content, freedom of speech, or interfere in civilian journalism, nor does it exercise any authority over public discourse beyond its lawful communication role".
Dawn newspaper - the oldest in Pakistan, founded in 1941 by the country's founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah - has taken a financial hit for its reporting. In December, Dawn Media Group said it had been subject to an unannounced ban on government adverts, firstly on its newspaper, then on its TV and radio outlets, a move the Council of Newspaper Editors said was "financially crippling the organisation".
"While some within the state may think that punishing outlets that refuse to toe the line may snuff out critical voices, in the modern age this is next to impossible," the editorial board said.
Information minister Atta Tarar denied that Dawn was denied government advertisement.
Several journalists said that thechanges to Pakistan's Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act in early 2025have made the environment more difficult.
Pakistan's authorities introduced the changes, saying they were needed to fight what the military has often termed "digital terrorism"; spreading what they see to be "anarchy and false information" to undermine the state. The country's constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and expression subject to reasonable restrictions, security sources told the BBC.
"It's false to claim Pakistan suppresses free speech," says Chaudhry. He cites the dangers of social media being used for financial fraud and recruiting terrorists. "We want to regulate social media, the whole world is regulating [it]."
But others say they can be used to limit journalists' ability to report.
"Changes made to the law have now made it an explicit crime to criticise the security establishment, the judiciary and definitions around national interest have been made even more vague. There are astonishingly steep fines and the penalties have been enhanced disproportionately," says Adnan Rehmat, a media analyst based in Islamabad.
He says there are the official rules, then there are further unspoken rules: "It's really difficult to know what the boundaries are, they are forever shifting."
Limitations on journalists are not new in Pakistan.Under Khan's government, journalists protested about restrictionsplaced on what they could publish and broadcast.
Syed sees the current situation as a continuation of the operation against the media. Jahangir also sees some level of historical continuity. "I can't say this has been the worst time, but let's say that times haven't improved for us."
While attempts to limit and intimidate critics have happened before, some think there is a new approach this time.
"It feels like something has shifted," says Azeema Cheema, an Islamabad-based research director specialising in conflict, fragility and violence. "Because now you are using the courts. You are using institutions, not extra institutional measures."
Those operating online outside Pakistan are in the authorities' sights too. In early January, seven Pakistani journalists and Youtubers, including two former army officers, were tried in absentia and given life sentences for digital terrorism. The prosecution accused them of "waging war against state" and "incitement" in relation to protests that took place on 9 May 2023 after Khan's first arrest.
In a post on X, one of the sentenced, Adil Raja, said "speaking truth to power is now called Digital Terrorism in Pakistan".
Syed and Cheema cite this case as a particularly stark example of harsh sentencing.
"There's been a growing realisation that the state is excessively willing and unapologetically willing to wield a blunt hammer," says Cheema.
Where that hammer may fall next is what many we spoke to are trying to calculate.

TITLE: At least 170 killed in air strikes during Myanmar's widely criticised election, UN says
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5gl8grv66o

At least 170 people were killed in military air strikes during Myanmar's weeks' long election period, the United Nations has said.
"Credible sources" had counted the civilian deaths, the UN rights office said, as well as 408 military aerial attacks from December 2025 to late last week, when the third and final round of voting was held.
The election itself has already been widely denounced as a sham, by numerous countries and human rights groups.
The Union and Solidarity Party (USDP), backed by Myanmar's military, won an overwhelming victory, according to state media - an outcome which was expected following the tightly-controlled vote.
Voting was not possible in large parts of the country, which has been engulfed in civil war sparked by a military coup which saw the democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi ousted and imprisoned in 2021.
Her party, the National League for Democracy, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, was not allowed to contest the vote.
Many believe the military junta will use the vote to maintain its power through proxy political parties.
UN rights chief Volker Turk described the election as "staged by the military" in a statement released on Friday.
He pointed out that "opposition candidates and some ethnic groups were excluded" from standing in the election, which had its first round on 28 December.
Turk added that people had made decisions "to vote or not to vote purely out of fear, flatly at odds with their internationally guaranteed civil and political rights".
Meanwhile, "the conflict and insecurity continued unabated in large parts of the country".
James Rodehaver, head of UN Human Rights' Myanmar team, said the figures on civilian deaths in military strikes were drawn from the period between the start of campaigning, in December, to the final voting day in late January.
The figures, which came from open sources, are likely to be currently incomplete "because of the way in which communications are cut off and... the fear of individuals in some of these locations to speak to us", he added, according to news agency AFP.
