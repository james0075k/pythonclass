TITLE: A string of scandals and luxury handbags: Who is South Korea's former first lady?
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3vpe8zme8o

Two Chanel handbags, a BMW dealership and a controversial church were at the centre of a trial faced by South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee.
The wife of disgraced former president Yoon Suk Yeol, she was arrested in August over a raft of charges including bribery, stock manipulation, and political interference - all of which she denies.
Prosecutors had accused Kim, 52, of making more than 800 million won ($552,570; £404,050) by participating in a price-rigging scheme involving the stocks of Deutsch Motors, a BMW dealer in South Korea, between October 2010 and December 2012.
She was also accused of accepting luxury bags, a diamond necklace and other gifts worth up to 80m won as bribes from the controversial Unification Church in exchange for business favours, and receiving 58 free opinion polls, worth 270 million Korean won, from political broker Myung Tae-kyun before the 2022 presidential election.
On Wednesday, a court found her guilty of accepting bribes from Unification Church officials, sentencing her to 20 months in jail.
However, she was cleared on charges of stock price manipulation and violating South Korea's campaign financing laws. There are still two cases against her that the court is yet to hear.
The verdict comes less than a fortnight after her husband was sentenced to jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid.
It also marks the first time in history that a presidential spouse has been indicted while detained.
But it is far from the first time Kim herself has been embroiled in controversy.
Before she was South Korea's first lady, Kim Keon Hee – born Kim Myeong-sin – was a businesswoman and art lover.
She graduated with an art education degree from Sookmyung Women's University in 1999, but would later face repeated allegations of plagiarism over her time as a student there – leading the university to annul her degree in 2025 after its research ethics panel found her thesis was compromised.
She has never commented on these allegations publicly.
In 2009, she founded art exhibition company Covana Contents, for which she is still CEO and president – but in 2019 South Korean media reported that she had allegedly evaded paying taxes and received kickbacks for hosting art exhibitions.
Kim, who has stood down from her role, was cleared of these charges in 2023, but the special counsel is currently re-examining the case.
Then, ahead of the 2022 presidential election which her husband ultimately won, allegations emerged that Kim had submitted applications to universities and companies containing false qualifications and awards, sparking a scandal over potentially fabricated credentials.
In response to these allegations, which some opposition members had sought to use as a political cudgel against Yoon, Kim issued a public apology for what she described as "exaggerations" on her resume.
She further pledged that if her husband became president she would "focus solely on my role as his wife".
It is her conduct while in that role, however, that has drawn some of the fiercest backlash.
In late-2023, spy camera footage surfaced showing Kim receiving a luxury handbag from an individual in a Seoul office in September 2022.
The footage was reported to have been secretly filmed by the pastor Choi Jae-young using a camera embedded in his watch – and its publication intensified public scrutiny on both Kim and Yoon.
It appeared to show Mr Choi walking to a store to purchase the greyish-blue calfskin bag, with a receipt putting its cost at 3 million won ($2,200; £1,800). Mr Choi then visits Covana Contents, a company in Seoul owned by the first lady, where Ms Kim then asks the pastor: "Why do you keep bringing me these things?"
South Korean law makes it illegal for public officials and their spouses to receive gifts worth more than 1 million won in one go, or a total of 3 million won within a fiscal year.
And while the video did not explicitly show Ms Kim accepting the gift, the Korea Herald reported at the time that the presidential office confirmed receipt of the bag and said that it was "being managed and stored as a property of the government".
The presidential office did not immediately respond to the coverage, further fuelling the controversy, as civic groups filed complaints with the prosecution citing potential violations of the Anti-Graft Act.
This incident was one of 16 allegations looked into by the special counsel team, 12 of which were passed to police for further investigation.
Wednesday's verdict, however,focusedon Kim allegedly accepting other bribes from the Unification Church, as well as her alleged involvement in Deutsch Motors stock manipulation and alleged election meddling.
Kim denied the charges - although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she says she later returned without using.
Prosecutors had last month called for a 15-year prison term and a fine of 2 billion won, saying she had "stood above the law" and colluded with the Unification Church to undermine the "constitutionally mandated separation of religion and state".
While Kim's string of scandals cast a shadow over her husband's presidential career, it was Yoon himself who ultimately sealed his own fate as one of South Korea's most disgraced former leaders.
On 16 January, Yoon was found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail.
It was the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to Yoon's shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.
Yoon's actions "plunged the country into political crisis", a judge said while delivering the verdict, noting that Yoon had "consistently shown no remorse".
It was during a year-long probe into Yoon's failed martial law attempt that special prosecutors started investigating many of the allegations against Kim.
Together, the once-powerful-couple make a historic pair: while South Korea has a history of former presidents being indicted and imprisoned, Yoon and Kim mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailed.
Kim Keon Hee was also ordered to return a Graff diamond necklace and pay back 12.85m won in cash.
About a million fans were vying for 150,000 concert tickets, which sold out in less than 40 minutes.
Trump has accused Seoul of "not living up" to a trade deal that was reached last year.

TITLE: China sends police to Australia in hunt for man who doused baby with coffee
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk86xkgm0no

China is sending a team to Australia to help in the search for a man who allegedly doused a baby with boiling coffee in 2024.
The nine-month old was attacked while his family were at a park in Brisbane's southern suburbs, suffering serious burns to his face and limbs.
The suspect fled the country before police identified him as a 33-year-old man, and is currently in China - a country with which Australia does not have an extradition arrangement.
China's ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian said on Thursday a "working group" would travel to Brisbane to assist the investigation.
"We are serious in addressing this concern, and we're serious in taking the necessary actions," Xiao told reporters in Canberra.
The team will work with Australian officials to "see what exactly happened, how it happened, and how both sides can work together as a follow-up", he added.
In a joint statement, Queensland Police and the Australian Federal Police said they are "supporting a delegation of Chinese authorities", thanking them for their "ongoing cooperation" given the challenges presented by the alleged offender's location.
"China has extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute its citizens for conduct which occurs outside China," the joint statement read.
An arrest warrant was issued for the man for acts intending to cause grievous bodily harm, a charge which in Australia could carry life imprisonment term.
Police have described the suspect as an "itinerant" worker who had travelled to Australia on multiple occasions between 2019 and 2024, and had addresses in the states of Victoria and New South Wales.
News of the incident sparked outrage across Australia because of the nature of the attack and the severity of the baby's burns.
The man allegedly dumped a Thermos of hot coffee on the baby while the family was having a picnic.
The boy required multiple skin graft surgeries in the weeks after the attack in August 2024.
Three months later, his parents provided an update saying though their son still had scarring on his chin and shoulder, everything else was "travelling well".

TITLE: Bill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywp0wy21lo

While the New England Patriots prepare for their 12th Super Bowl appearance, their former head coach Bill Belichick - widely considered to be the greatest professional football coach of all time - finds himself in an unlikely position: defending his legacy.
Although Belichick has the most Super Bowl victories in NFL history, he received a phone call on Friday notifying him he would not be inducted into this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class.
"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?" Belichick asked with disappointment, according to ESPN which broke the news, referring to his six wins with the Patriots.
The latest setback adds to a series of misfortunes for Belichick, who ended his nearly 50-year NFL coaching career on a losing streak, and, in a rather unexpected decision, left the pinnacle of American football to coach college students.
Just a few months ago, Belichick made his college football debut to a sell-out crowd of over 50,000 people packed into University of North Carolina's football stadium.
When he walked onto the field for the first time, the roar of tens of thousands of screaming fans erupted into the night sky.
But it didn't end well.
The Tar Heels suffered a stinging defeat to the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs that night, and never quite recovered. By the end of the 12-game season, the team finished with just four wins – its worst record since 2018.
The paradox between Belichick's legendary NFL career and his spectacularly poor first year in college football is complicating his legacy. After nearly 50 years coaching professional football, why Belichick accepted an offer to step down to the amateur leagues remains a big question. When he will quit is becoming an even bigger one.
"He's going to have one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career trying to get year two to be better than year one in North Carolina," said Dan Roche, an award-winning sports anchor with the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.
"If they struggle again, I think that will basically be the end of the coaching career of Bill Belichick," he continued.
For years, the trend in college football has been that coaches typically leave the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for greater prestige and bigger salaries in the NFL.
But the college league – which generates over $1.3bn (£940.5m) in revenue – is starting to catch up.
"North Carolina decided to roll the dice and invest a lot of money in its football program," said Greg Barnes, senior reporter at Inside Carolina, a website dedicated to North Carolina University sports.
And with that came Belichick, who signed a five-year $50m (£36m) deal to join the Tar Heels.
"That kind of money is unheard of for North Carolina football," Barnes said, notwithstanding that the contract went to 73-year-old Belichick who previously had never coached a single game of college football.
Most sports experts who've followed his career suspect he's not in it for the money.
For Belichick, they say, it's part love of the game, part love for coaching, and part an affliction that has ailed many great sports figures: an inability to know when to say goodbye.
"I can't recall many head coaches who have said, 'Okay, I've done it all, and now I'm going to walk away'," Roche said. "I just think they don't have it in them."
Belichick was born into a football family.
His father, Steve Belichick, had a long college coaching career, including 30 years at the US Naval Academy and two years at North Carolina.
The younger Belichick's understanding of football was also nurtured by his mother, Jeannette, with whom he spent many weekends watching games on TV.
Belichick played football and lacrosse at Wesleyan University where he graduated in 1975 with an economics degree. Having never played in the professional league, he began his NFL career that same year as a staff assistant.
"He doesn't look like a football coach. He's not an overwhelming physical presence. He's not a screamer," said ESPN senior writer Seth Wickersham. "He's kind of a quirky, introverted thinker."
"And he revolutionised professional football," Wickersham said.
By 1985, Belichick had climbed the ranks to become the defensive coordinator of one of America's premier football teams, the New York Giants. There, he won his first two Super Bowls.
However, he truly forged his legacy during his decades-long career as the New England Patriots head coach.
He joined the team in 2000. One year later, with the help of quarterback Tom Brady, they won their first Super Bowl. Then five more after that. Altogether, the Brady-and-Belichick-led Patriots appeared in the Super Bowl nine times, the most under any single head coach in NFL history .
Mike Reiss, an ESPN staff writer who covers the Patriots, attributed Belichick's success to being "a master strategist".
"When he was at his peak powers, he almost knew the opposition more than the opposition knew themselves," Reiss said.
Belichick's critics point to a series of scandals that rocked the Patriots during his tenure, including in 2007 when he was fined $500,000 (£362,000) for ordering his staff to spy on other teams, and in 2016, when Brady was suspended for four games for deflating footballs to his advantage.
In 2020, Brady left the Patriots, reportedly in part due to Belichick's unwillingness to give Brady, then-aged 43, the longer contract Brady wanted.
Brady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the same year and won his seventh Super Bowl. In Belichick's final two seasons with the Patriots, he led the team to one of its worst records since the 1990s.
Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways in January 2024. He was unable to find another NFL team to take him after that.
"It was a stunning rebuke by the NFL," said Wickersham, author of New York Times bestseller It's Better to be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness.
"For the first time since 1975", Wickersham said, "Belichick was out of football".
It was during one of the lowest points of Belichick's professional career that he received the call from North Carolina.
Outside of a few sceptics, college football fans were engulfed in enthusiasm.
"Congrats coach," Tom Brady posted on social media. "The Tar Heel way is about to become a thing 100."
With his name emblazoned on merchandise, home-game tickets for the entire season sold out weeks before it started.
But Belichick was unable to reverse the bad fortune that appeared to follow him from his final years in the NFL.
After their defeat in game one, the Tar Heels would go on to lose most games, including every match against their three in-state rivals, something the team hadn't done since 1989.
As the season losses piled up, so did the number of empty seats inside North Carolina's football stadium.
For some, like North Carolina Alumni Association member Deborah Melvin, it was painful to witness even from home.
"It was just disheartening," she said. "He was supposed to be Mr Super Coach."
Adding to fans' frustrations was the incessant press coverage of Belichick's romantic relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old beauty pageant contestant and amateur cheerleader.
Wickersham called it "the most scrutinized relationship ever for an American sports coach".
Hudson made headlines. Lots of headlines. Like when she was rumoured to have been banned from North Carolina's athletic facilities and the university had to put out a statement saying she wasn't. Or the time when she appeared next to Belichick on the sidelines on game day wearing a reptile mini-skirt and knee-high boots. Or the time when she filed a trademark application for the term "gold digger".
Belichick couldn't avoid the gossip columns either, making his own headlines amid multiple appearances at Hudson's cheerleading competitions and beauty pageants.
Wickersham said he found the Belichick-Hudson saga to be "surprising", adding that it contributed to the noise surrounding Belichick who previously "was a master at limiting distractions".
"It's definitely different than the Belichick who was with New England all those years," Wickersham said.
The university declined a request from the BBC to interview Belichick.
The Tar Heels' bad season has not been blamed on Hudson, though. It was a variety of other factors.
This was Belichick's first time coaching a college football team, a group composed of a bunch of teenagers with often much steeper learning curves compared to the pros of the NFL.
The other major challenge was recruiting. Belichick joined the Tar Heels after the deadline for high school athletes to accept their college offers. That meant he missed the chance to persuade some of America's best high school football talent to join his team this year.
"To get the system in place is more than just turning a light switch on," North Carolina football manager Mike Lombardi said after the season.
"I'm not making any excuses, but when we first got here, we didn't have time to turn the light switch on," he said. "We had to just get into the dark room."
Lombardi's remarks came during a signing ceremony on 3 December, as the team celebrated the new class of recruits joining the Tar Heels' next season.
"They will be a foundation of our program," Belichick said.
For now, quitting does not appear to be an option for the all-time great coach.
"'Why are you still doing this? You could be doing anything,'" Weiss said he once asked Belichick toward the end of his career with the Patriots. "And he replied, 'It beats working.'
"I'll never forget that, because I feel like this is what he feels like he was born to do."

TITLE: Panic on crowded Ukraine train - passenger describes moment of Russian drone strike
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjwpq4pggjo

A Ukrainian soldier has described the moment a passenger train was targeted by Russian drones, killing five people.
When a carriage on the train was hit in northeastern Ukraine, passengers threw themselves on the floor in panic and the military officer told them to get out immediately.
Without his instruction, issued moments before the carriage burst into flames, many more passengers could have died.
The officer, whose army call-sign is Omar, is part of Ukraine's 93rd brigade. He was among the passengers travelling on a route from Chop, on the border with Slovakia, to Barvinkove, the last stop before the front line in eastern Ukraine.
The first of three Russian drones landed near the train, forcing it to come to a halt.
"Then we heard the rumble of another drone, and then an explosion," Omar tells the BBC. "The blast was so strong that parts of the carriage shattered into splinters."
As the commander of a drone unit, he quickly realised he and the other passengers had to get out as the train could get hit again. In all, 291 people were on the train at the time, officials say.
"After the second hit, I understood that the drone operator was observing what kind of target it was hitting," Omar says, and a stationary train was an easy target.
The carriage that suffered a direct hit quickly became engulfed in flames. "I am in the military and I am prepared for such attacks," says Omar. "But for others it was a shock to be so close to death."
Many passengers evacuated the train in a state of deep distress, and videos from the scene show people screaming and crying as they move away from the smouldering wreck.
It was too dangerous for such a large number of people to stay near the burning carriages, so he urged them to start moving towards a nearby motorway.
He then went back to the train with some of the other passengers to check if anyone had been left behind. Inspecting the carriages, he saw a body and continued to look for survivors. Five people lost their lives in the attack.
In the final carriage, Omar found a young woman with a baby.
"She was very scared and had no idea what to do but thank God she was alive," he says.
She barely had time to put on warm clothes, and screamed she needed to go back to the carriage to retrieve her suitcase and documents, the officer says.
"I came here to bring my son," she told Omar as she was getting off the train. Later, Omar understood she had been travelling to the front line so that her soldier husband could see their child.
The attack on the passenger train in Kharkiv region was condemned by President Volodymyr Zelensky as terrorism.
It hit the heart of the railway system - a symbol of resilience in a country where the airspace has been closed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Millions of Ukrainians rely on the 21,000km-long (13,000-mile) railway network to travel around the country and to cross the border into neighbouring countries, from which they can then catch flights.
Although the railways have been targeted in the past, by and large Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia rail company has been able to keep people moving on its vast network - although escalating attacks on infrastructure and severe weather have led to increasingly long delays.
Trains to the frontline city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region were eventually suspended last autumn, once the area became too dangerous due to sustained aerial Russian attacks.
On Wednesday, flags flew at half-mast in railway stations across Ukraine. The daily minute of silence observed across the country was dedicated to the victims of the drone strike on the train.
Hours after the attack had taken place, services were running again on the Barvinkove-Chop line.

TITLE: China executes 11 members of Myanmar scam mafia
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gdrvy9gjo

China has executed 11 members of a notorious mafia family that ran scam centres in Myanmar along its north-eastern border, state media report.
The Ming family members were sentenced in September for various crimes including homicide, illegal detention, fraud and operating gambling dens by a court in China's Zhejiang province.
The Mings were one of many clans that ran the town of Laukkaing, transforming an impoverished backwater town into a flashy hub of casinos and red-light districts.
Their scam empire came crashing down in 2023, when they were detained and handed over to China by ethnic militias that had taken control of Laukkaing during an escalation in their conflict with Myanmar's army.
With these executions Beijing is sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. But the business has now moved to Myanmar's border with Thailand, and to Cambodia and Laos, where China has much less influence.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the UN. Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese too.
Frustrated by the Myanmar military's refusal to stop the scam business, from which it was almost certainly profiting, Beijing tacitly backed an offensive by an ethnic insurgent alliance in Shan State in late 2023. The alliance captured significant territory from the military and overran Laukkaing, a key border town.

The eleven members of the Ming family are the first of the Myanmar scam bosses to be executed by China.
But they will not be the last. Five members of the Bai family were also sentenced to death in November, and the trials of two other groups of defendants from the Wei and the Liu families have not yet concluded.
The Ming family's trial was held behind closed doors, although more than 160 people were allowed to attend their sentencing hearing last year, including families of victims.
The Ming mafia's scam operations and gambling dens brought in more than 10bn yuan ($1.4bn; £1bn) between 2015 and 2023, according to China's highest court, which rejected their appeals in November. Their crimes resulted in the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and injuries to many others, the court said.
More than 20 others from the Ming family were given jail sentences in September ranging from five years to life. Ming Xuechang, the clan's patriarch, killed himself in 2023 while trying to avoid detention, Myanmar's military had said back then.
The confessions of those who were arrested wereaired in state media documentaries, to emphasise Chinese authorities' resolveto eradicate scam networks.
The Mings were among a handful of Godfather-esque families who rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s. This was after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing, who became the leader of Myanmar's military government after the 2021 coup.
The head of the family, Ming Xuechang, ran one of the most infamous of Laukkaing's scam centres, Crouching Tiger Villa.
At first gambling and prostitution were the main sources of income for these families, but they eventually started online fraud, staffed mostly by people who were kidnapped and forced to run these scams.
Within the walls of the sprawling, well-guarded compounds was a culture of violence. Beatings and torture were routine, according to testimonies collected from freed workers.
Investors are spooked by an order on a 2018 stake sale and fear it could open up old transactions to tax scrutiny.
Guan Heng secretly filmed detention facilitates in Xinjiang before escaping to the US in 2021.
The nine-month-old baby was attacked with boiling liquid while at a family picnic in 2024.
The new ban is due to Bluetongue Virus (BTV),  cases of which have been detected in four herds in County Wexford.
Richard Parker says the trip is "about delivering for people back home" and follows his 2025 visit.
