Match report as Chelsea beat Napoli to finish sixth in the Champions League league phase; Joao Pedro scored two brilliant goals to win it for Liam Rosenior's side; Enzo Fernandez had put Chelsea ahead in the first half; the Blues go straight into the round of 16

Two sublime strikes from Joao Pedro fired Chelsea into the Champions League round of 16 as they finished sixth in the league phase table after a 3-2 win at Napoli.
The Blues were in a precarious position heading into the final game - only in the top eight on goal difference as they looked to avoid two additional games in the knockout play-offs.
Chelsea made a perfect start when they were awarded an early penalty. Juan Jesus was penalised for handball from a Blues free-kick, and despite Napoli's protests, Enzo Fernandez converted.
But the setback seemed to rouse Napoli into life.
Enzo Fernandez has a 100 per cent penalty record this season. He has now scored five from five, and second in a row after his penalty against Crystal Palace at the weekend.
They started to overrun Chelsea in the hunt for an equaliser, which deservedly came just after half an hour. It was Maradona-esque from hometown boy Antonio Vergara as he charged into the box, spinning past Wesley Fofana before slotting home.
And just before the break, Manchester United loanee Rasmus Hojlund smashed Napoli ahead, getting across the front of Fofana before hammering home.
Chelsea had set up with a three at the back in Naples, with Liam Rosenior attempting to take on the 3-4-3 master Antonio Conte at his own game.

But it was clear by half-time those tactics were not working. Cole Palmer was introduced at the break, but there was no change of shape, whichSky Sports'Paul Merson said was 'not a good move'.
"It's not the substitution, it's the system they should have changed," he added onSoccer Special.
Eventually, with the introduction of Jamie Gittens and Trevoh Chalobah in the 59th minute, Chelsea finally reverted to a back four and, mere minutes later, the Blues equalised.
It was the first of two wonderful goals from Pedro, who skipped the ball around his defender before thundering the ball home from the top of the area.
From then on, Chelsea looked far more comfortable and won it with eight minutes of normal time to play. It was another clinical finish from Pedro, finishing low past Meret, and the goalkeeper could only watch the ball roll past his weak outstretched foot.
It was the Blues' first Champions League away win of the season and they finished with 16 points and ahead of Sporting and Manchester City.
Chelsea will not play in Europe again until March and will face one ofQarabag,Monaco,NewcastleorPSGin the round of 16.
Antonio Conte has now failed to reach the knockout rounds in 50 per cent of this Champions League campaigns (four out of eight). The furthest he has ever been in Europe is the quarter-finals, which he has reached once with Juventus in his first campaign.
For Napoli though, it is a disaster of a European campaign as they are knocked out in the league phase.
Their entire season has been decimated by injuries, but there is shock as to how the Serie A champions have finished 30th out of 36 teams.
Chelsea head coachLiam RoseniortoTNT Sports:"I thought the character of the players, the resilience in the second half, the reaction to going behind was so positive - all the things I'm asking for.
"I wanted to go aggressive in the first half. We had wing-back moments in their half, but at the same time, the distances were too big. We corrected it at half-time, I made personnel changes.
"Joao Pedro scored some magnificent goals in a magnificent performance from him. He's given that to me since I came to the club. All in all, we're through, and we're delighted.
"A team hasn't won here in a long time so for the lads to come from behind and show character, it makes me very happy.
"I'm learning all the time about my team, what we're capable of, about what I need to tweak and adapt for them but we really wanted to be front-footed today. I wanted to go out and try and win the game, which was so important.
"In the end, we did but in a different way than I expected.
"I've got outstanding players. I've got a group and I trust them and the subs are always the players that make the difference in the big games."
On not having to play knockout play-off games:"It's massive for us to really be able to work with the players on the training ground because the schedule has meant we've played, we've recovered, we're prepped a game and gone again.
Joao Pedro speaking to TNT Sports:"Very happy for the victory. The team did a brilliant game."My goals... I tried to do my best to help my team-mates. Today I scored two brilliant goals."The coach said to be calm, play our game on the pitch. The first half we didn't do it, the second half was open so it's why we scored two goals."It's very positive for us. People had a lot of doubts about us. I'm happy. Now it's time to focus on the Premier League."
"So to actually work with the players on the training pitch and for them to understand what we want to do as a staff with them will be great.
"I can run them and get them fitter as well which will be good.
"You have to enjoy these moments, but we want more. We have some huge games coming up, starting with West Ham on Saturday.
"You're in the Champions League and to win this competition, you have to beat the best. Whoever we play, we'll give it our best shot. I'm just delighted that we're through in this manner."
Sky Sports' Joe Shread:
Liam Rosenior regularly switched between three and four-man defences at Strasbourg, and that tactical versatility was on display in Naples.
Reece James being listed as a centre-back on the teamsheet raised eyebrows, not least given he would have to contend with the much-taller Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay charging into the box.
Ultimately, James was untroubled aerially, but Rosenior's decision to match Napoli's back three - the first time he has deployed that set up in his new job - backfired.
Chelsea may have taken the lead but they struggled to escape Napoli's press and were regularly breached down their left as Marc Cucurella and Pedro Neto struggled to adapt to their new roles, allowing Napoli to take a lead into half-time.
"Chelsea tried to match up Napoli, but it hasn't worked. They needed to bring on [Trevoh] Chalobah or [Benoit] Badiashile to play at centre half and go back to a four, with [Cole] Palmer as a No 10," saidSky Sports' Paul Merson.
With his team heading for the play-offs, Rosenior headed back to the drawing board. Within 14 minutes of the second half, Palmer and Chalobah were on, James was back on the right and Chelsea had reverted to a back four in possession.
Two minutes later, Pedro levelled. By full-time, he had scored again, Chelsea were into the last 16 and Rosenior had arguably the biggest win of his managerial career to date.
"We corrected it - I made personnel changes," Rosenior said. It's fair to question why Rosenior decided a game of this magnitude was the right time to trial a system that is unfamiliar to this squad. Chalobah should have started. The out-of-form Wesley Fofana and Neto were exposed. The result should not have been unexpected.
But the head coach deserves credit for admitting his error and giving his side the tools to dig themselves out of a hole.
"I'm learning all the time," he said. The lessons taken from the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium will be valuable - especially with Paris Saint-Germain potentially lurking in the last 16.

TITLE: Man City 2-0 Galatasaray: Erling Haaland and Rayan Cherki earn spot in last 16 of Champions League

Match report as Manchester City secured spot in top eight of the Champions League league phase and safe passage to round of 16, which takes place in March; Erling Haaland scored for first time in five outings while Rayan Cherki netted his eighth of the campaign in all comps
Football Journalist
Thursday 29 January 2026 08:12, UK
Erling Haaland ended his five-game goal drought as Manchester City booked their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a simple 2-0 win over Galatasaray.
Against the backdrop of last week's shock defeat to Bodo/Glimt, victory was the only acceptable result for Pep Guardiola's side, while still relying on others to slip up in order to secure a top-eight finish. City got their wish.
While Real Madrid, PSG and Newcastle all fell away, City took care of business in the first half of their tie as Haaland scored his first goal from open play since the turn of the year, and Rayan Cherki followed up with a well-worked second. Both strikes were teed up by the electric Jeremy Doku before he was forced off clutching his calf.
An eighth-place league phase finish means City narrowly avoid the unwanted fixture headache of a play-off tie in February, instead progressing straight to the round of 16 in March, where they will face one of Benfica, Bodo/Glimt, Inter Milan or Real Madrid. Galatasaray, who offered very little on the night, still sneak through in 20th place.
Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea complete a top-eight dominated by Premier League teams, with Newcastle the only English side to miss out after being held to adamaging draw at PSG.
Man City:Donnarumma (7), Nunes (6), Khusanov (7), Ake (6), Ait-Nouri (8), Bernardo (6), O'Reilly (7), Cherki (8), Marmoush (5), Doku (7), Haaland (7).Subs:Foden (6), Reijnders (6), Nico (n/a).Galatasaray:Cakir (6), Jakobs (6), Bardakci (6), Sanchez (5), Sallai (5), Gundogan (5), Lemina (5), Yilmaz (6), Sara (5), Sane (5), Osimhen (7).Subs:Torreira (5), Elmali (6), Akgun (6), Ayhan (n/a), Icardi (n/a).Player of the Match:Rayan Cherki
Sky Sports' Laura Hunter at Etihad Stadium:
Pep Guardiola will take a lot of satisfaction from that result, on what was his 569th game in charge of Manchester City in all competitions. It brings up a staggering 400 wins.

There have been a couple of bumps in the road during this qualifying campaign but nothing compared to last year's potholes. City were able to style out setbacks, but make no mistake, they will need to improve to go deep in this competition.
In the context of their season, though, two fewer games in February is invaluable. Erling Haaland is back among the goals, taking his opener with all the composure of a striker who had been scoring every week, while Rayan Cherki continues to grow in stature and influence.
No Premier League player has more goal involvements since the start of December in all competitions than him (11).
Sky Sports' Lewis Jones:
For Manchester City, avoiding the Champions League play-offs could prove to be one of the defining moments of their campaign. In Guardiola's world, where control, rhythm and physical condition are king, the added rest is absolutely massive.
After City travel to Fulham on February 11, the calendar suddenly softens in a way that elite clubs rarely experience at this stage of the season. A 10-day window opens up where the only commitment is a home FA Cup tie against Salford. No European stress and travel. Just breathing space.
The Champions League play-offs are brutal examinations: two high-stress games that demand full emotional investment and total physical output. By bypassing them, City gain something far more valuable than momentum. City can narrow their focus.
The Premier League becomes the clear target as their routine stabilises. That calm is something Guardiola's sides thrive on, especially when the pressure ramps up in March and April. And when the Premier League enters its decisive phase, don't be surprised if this quiet slice of fixture fortune plays a very loud role in how the title race unfolds.

Man City bossPep Guardiola:
"A lot of things to improve, but really pleased to finish top eight considering how the Champions League has become. When I started here the Champions League was a different type of competition. Today every team is really, really tough.
"We had clear chances to score more. It's risky. Considering how many top, top teams are out of the top eight, it's so difficult [to qualify automatically]. Even winning in Norway, it's difficult.
"Pleased we don't play the knockout stage and hopefully we can arrive in March at our best. Of course it's better to rest."
On Jeremy Doku's injury: "The calf, he felt something. Jeremy has had these problems, with the demands on his effort. Hopefully in March he can be ready to help us."

When is the Champions League knockout phase play-off draw? What teams are involved? When will the games be played? How does the format work? All questions answered as 16 teams look to reach the knock-out stages...
Thursday 29 January 2026 08:14, UK
The Champions League league phase is over - we know eight teams heading for the last 16, but who now has two extra games in their schedules for the right to join them, and who will they play?
The top eight teams -Arsenal,Bayern Munich,Liverpool,Tottenham,Barcelona,Chelsea,SportingandMan City- have all qualified for the next round of the Champions League, but we still don't know who they will face in the knock-out phases.
Here's everything you need to know about the play-off draw and who's involved...
The teams ranked ninth to 24th in the league phase will now go head-to-head in two-legged play-off games to determine which eight will progress as the unseeded sides for the last 16, where their opponents will be determined by who finished where in the top eight.
Each play-off side already knows from their league position they will end up in one of two paths. For instance, Real Madrid and Inter Milan, the teams in ninth and 10th, will each play one of Bodo/Glimt and Benfica in the play-offs, the teams in 23rd and 24th. The same with 11th and 12th vs one or 21st and 22nd, and so on. Exactly who plays who will be determined at the knock-out play-off draw.
Teams from the same national associationcanplay each other at this stage - as can teams who faced one another in the league phase.
The draw will be held from UEFA's headquarters in Switzerland on Friday January 30, with a scheduled start time of 11am - though expect it to begin a little later to get through all the formalities, montages and guest presenters.

The Premier League has five clubs in the last 16 of the Champions League, with Newcastle hoping to make it six via the play-offs; Arsenal to benefit from home second legs up to the semi-finals; Jose Mourinho's Benfica claim play-off spot in remarkable style
Football Features Writer@nicholaspwright
Thursday 29 January 2026 08:09, UK
The league phase of the Champions League reached a thrilling conclusion with 18 simultaneous games and a total of 61 goals, including one by Benfica goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin.
LeadersArsenalmaintained their perfect record with a 3-2 victory over Kairat Almaty.Liverpool,Tottenham,ChelseaandManchester Cityalso clinched top-eight finishes to go straight into the last 16.
Here's a look at some of the key themes from the league phase and what we know about the impending knockout stages.
The final standings underline the strength of the Premier League.
Five of the top eight are English clubs, while no other nation has more than one.
Germany, Spain and Portugal have a representative each in Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Sporting.
Newcastle are the only English side to have missed out on a top-eight finish but go into the knockout phase play-offs as one of the seeded sides, having finished 12th, meaning they will face one of two unseeded teams in Qarabag or Monaco.

Since the introduction of the league phase format last season, the Premier League has had a combined eight top-eight finishes. It's more than twice as many as any other league, with Spain's La Liga next on three.
One of the benefits of English teams performing so strongly in Europe is that the Premier League is now all but certain to repeat last season's feat of clinching a fifth Champions League spot by finishing in the top two of UEFA's coefficient table.
With five Premier League teams having gone straight into the Champions League last 16, and with all nine Premier League teams in Europe still alive in their respective competitions, England sits comfortably top of the table ahead of Germany.
Newcastle were the beneficiaries last season, clinching their place in this campaign's Champions League with a fifth-placed Premier League finish. Now the door is open for another side to take advantage as English teams continue to perform strongly on the continent.
With Newcastle the only English club in the knockout phase play-offs, there is no prospect of an all-English play-off.
The earliest opportunity for two English sides to meet is in the last 16, when Newcastle could come up against Chelsea, although we will have to wait until the draw for the last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals on February 27 for that.

The earliest opportunity for any other all-English meetings is in the quarter-finals, when Manchester City could meet Arsenal and Chelsea or Newcastle could meet Tottenham or Liverpool.
While five of the six Premier League sides will benefit from back-to-back free midweeks in February having gone straight into the last 16, Newcastle add two games to an already hectic schedule.
Eddie Howe's side will play their play-off first and second legs on February 17 or 18 and February 24 or 25, in between Premier League games away to Manchester City on February 21 and at home to Everton on February 28.
Arsenal's first-place finish gives them a number of advantages. As the No 1 seed, they can't play a seed higher than 15th in the last 16, a seed higher than seventh until the quarter-final, Liverpool or Tottenham until the semis,andthey avoid Bayern Munich until the final.
In addition, they will benefit from a new rule this season that states that the top two league phase finishers will play their second legs at home throughout the whole competition.
Meetings between Manchester City and Real Madrid have become annual events in the Champions League. The two sides have faced each other in five consecutive seasons in the competition having already gone head-to-head in the league phase in December.
Now they could meet again in the last 16.
With Real Madrid having slipped into the play-off places, they will face either City or Sporting if they can get through their play-off tie against either Benfica or Bodo/Glimt.
Another meeting between Real Madrid would be good news for the neutral, if their previous knockout meetings are anything to go by. The last five two-legged ties have featured 40 goals, with Madrid advancing on three occasions and City on two.
Incredible drama in Lisbon saw Jose Mourinho'sBenficaclinch a play-off spot on goal difference thanks to a 98th-minute goal by goalkeeper Trubin against Real Madrid.
Remarkably, Benfica may now face Mourinho's former club in the play-offs, with the goal simultaneously knocking Real Madrid down to ninth.

But despite accusations of lack of jeopardy for the big clubs following the introduction of the league phase format last season, there were still some big beasts to fall this time around.
In fact, there are six European Cup wins among the clubs eliminated, with past winnersAjax,MarseilleandPSV Eindhovenamong the 12 clubs to bow out.
Napoli, Serie A winners last season, also went out having slumped to a 30th-placed league phase finish with their 3-2 loss to Chelsea, having won only two of their eight games under Antonio Conte.
Spain'sVillarreal, two-time Champions League semi-finalists, went out even more meekly, failing to win a single game and taking a solitary point from their eight games as they finished second-bottom in 35th place.
